# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Hand-Gesture
Tic Tac Toe using Hand Gesture is a variation of the classic game where players use hand gestures instead of physical pieces to make moves on the game board. Instead of clicking or tapping on a screen or a physical board, players use hand movements recognized by a computer vision system to place their marks (typically 'X' or 'O') on the game grid.
